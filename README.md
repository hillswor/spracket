#### _Spracket_:

_Spracket_ is a multi-purpose tool used to access the extensive [_Bike Index_](https://bikeindex.org/why-donate) database.

---

Upon being opened _Spracket_ employs the _[Geolocation API](https://w3c.github.io/geolocation-api/#geolocation_interface)_ to search for bicycles lost or stolen in proximity to the user.

The user can choose the radial distance of the bike search from a menu of options.

Each bike is presented in it's own interactive profile through which the user can click to see a photo of the bike as well as useful details including it's last known location, manufacturer, serial number, and more.

The user can sort results by name, brand, or date lost.

The user can submit a sightings report that will be added to a bicycle profile on the local _Spracket_ server.

_"A biker who rode every day,
Had their bike snatched and carried away,
They searched high and low,
And their heart sank - OH NO!
Till they found **Spracket** and shouted "hooray!"_

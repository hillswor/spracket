#### _Spracket_:

_Spracket_ is a multi-purpose tool used to access the extensive [_Bike Index_](https://bikeindex.org/why-donate) database.

Upon being opened _Spracket_ employs the [Geolocation API](https://w3c.github.io/geolocation-api/#geolocation_interface) to search for bicycles lost or stolen in proximity to the user. The results

As a Spracket user I am greeted with a gallery or bicycles lost or stolen in proximity to my current location (as accquired through the use of the [Geolocation API](https://w3c.github.io/geolocation-api/#geolocation_interface).)

Each result is presented as it's own interactive element through which I can click to to see a photo of the bike as well as useful details including it's last known location, manufacturer, serial number and more. I can sort results by name, brand, or date lost.

If I have seen a bike since it's date lost I report that sighting and the information submitted will be added to the profile. I can also look through a complete list of recent sightings reported by other users.

_A biker who rode every day,
Had his bike stolen and carried away,
He searched high and low,
And his heart sank - OH NO!
Till they found **Spracket** and shouted "hooray!"_

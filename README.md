##### _Spracket_:

_Spracket_ is a multi-purpose tool used to access the extensive [_Bike Index_](https://bikeindex.org/why-donate) database.

---

Upon being opened _Spracket_ employs the _[Geolocation API](https://w3c.github.io/geolocation-api/#geolocation_interface)_ to search for bicycles lost or stolen in proximity to the user.

The user can choose the radial distance of the bike search from a menu of options.

Each bike is presented in it's own interactive profile through which the user can click to see a photo of the bike as well as useful details including last known location, manufacturer, serial number, and more.

The user can sort results by name, brand, or date lost.

The user can submit a sightings report to be added to a selected bike profile on the local _Spracket_ server and will receive a status alert regarding the submission.

_"A biker who rode every day,<br>
_Had their bike snatched and carried away,_<br>
_They searched high and low,_<br>
_And their heart sank - OH NO!_<br>
_Till they met **Spracket** and shouted "hooray!"_      -_ChatGPT_, 2023
